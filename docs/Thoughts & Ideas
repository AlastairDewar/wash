Would be cool, if there was support for drop in plugins. Like, you could paste a svn module in or something.

Gonna need to find some one of checking for requirements and setting up anything that needs setup. But I'd rather avdoid it.

Thought of a nice new feature, being able to install apps remotelty. It searches the respotistory, if theres a lack of results, it requests the repository address/debian package/whatever.

If the user goes into the backup section and theres nothing setup, give them the option of install rsync and entering the details of backups or whatever

Can we use system user credentials - See php5-pam-auth
